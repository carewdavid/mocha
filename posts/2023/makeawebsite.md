# Make a Website

Make your own website.
Put some words on it, maybe pictures. Whatever you want.
If you happen to already have the skills (and time) to make it look pretty, that's great.
Don't worry if you don't, just make it anyway and do what you can.
Just make your own little piece of internet.
